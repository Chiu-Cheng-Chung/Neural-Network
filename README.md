# Neural Network
The Tensorflow used by these codes is the 1st generation version. 

Most of the training sets and test sets here use the officially provided MNIST.

You can get MNIST here http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. 

If you have any questions, please contact me at craigchiu0619@gmail.com

It's the old version, but I'd like to keep the code.
